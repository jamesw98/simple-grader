Doctor Freeman. I realize this moment may not be the most convenient for a heart-to-heart, but I had to wait until your friends were otherwise occupied. Hm.
There was a time they cared nothing for Miss Vance... When their only experience of humanity was a crowbar coming at them down a steel corridor.
When I plucked her from Black Mesa, I acted in the face of objections that she was a mere child and of no practical use to anyone. I have learned to ignore such naysayers when quelling them was out of the question.
Still, I am not one to squander my investments... and I remain confident she was worth far more than the initial...appraisal.
That's why I must now extract from you some small repayment owed for your own survival.
See her safely to White Forest, Doctor Freeman.
I wish I could do more than keep an eye on you, but I have agreed to abide by certain... restrictions.
Mmm. Well... Now... Listen carefully, my dear. When you see your father relay these words:
Prepare for unforeseen consequences.
